#Wio Node
## Introduction
----
Building IoT project is exciting, as you can connect almost everything around you and control them. However it is also not easy to build IoT applications since it requires a lot of hard works such as hardware programming, jump wires, soldering etc.Even a well trained user would spend hours to hanlde all the work, let alone beginers. In order to simplify the development of IoT project, Seeed launched **[Wio Link](http://www.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Wio_Link)** on **[kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/seeed/wio-link-3-steps-5-minutes-build-your-iot-applicat?ref=nav_search)** and it turn out a big sucess.The slogen on kickstarter well defined the main feature of Wio link:

**3 steps. 5 minutes. Build your own IoT applications!** 

It is so simple, it is fast buiding, however it is not ideal for all conditions.
What if we only need 2 grove connectors? What if there is limited space in the appication but Wio Link is over sized? What if we want to cost down? So right after we released Wio Link, a micro and economic solution was put on schedule,for months Seeeder has redesigned and optimized the WiFI board and here it is,the new member of Wio family---**Wio Node**.

Just like the meaning of its name, Wio Node is truly a WiFi node that connect things in IoT project. If Wio Link is big brother, Wio node must be the little brother in the Wio family coz this cute little guy is only quarter size of Wio link while intergrates all the basic features of Wio Link.

The ecosystem of Wio Node also consists of Open Hardware **Wio Node board**, **Open Source Wio Link Mobile App** and **Open Source IoT Server implementation**. So the software platform for Wio Link is also available for Wio Node.

!!!Note
    Some of the recipes are made by Wio Link, you can replace it with a Wio Node.

## Hardware Overview

### Bonus!
Wio Node has an inbuilt LiPo battery charger, so you can charge 3.7v LiPo battery through JST 2.0 Port when USB is connecting.

!!!Note
    * Please handle the USB micro type-B socket gently, or you may break the socket apart from the board.
    * Battery is not included in the package. But we have arranged plenty of choices for you in [Bazzar](https://www.seeedstudio.com/s/battery.html).



## Get Started
----
Let us build a very basic LED application with Wio Node,in this application you will be able to control LED by your smartphone in about 5 minutes.Before we start, please make sure you have below things on hand:

|Wio Node|Grove - LED|Micro USB Cable|
|--------|-----------|---------------|

!!!NOTE
    * A smartphone is needed as well(Android OS version 4.1 or advanced, iOS version 7 or advanced)
    * Grove - LED include a Grove cable already
### **STEP 1:** Install Android/iOS App
You need to install the Wio Link App to manage and configure your Wio Node devices.

Download the Android or iOS App and install. Or you can go to app store of Apple or Google market and search "Wio Link",you will find it.

|Android|iOS|
|:---:|:---:|

!!!Note
    Make sure your Android OS version is 4.1 or advanced, iOS version is 7 or advanced.

### **STEP 2:** Create your Account
- If it is your first time to use Wio APP,you may need to sign up first.
- If you already have an account, check the server location before logging in, a wrong server location may lead to falure when connecting to Wio Node.

![](https://github.com/SeeedDocument/Wio_Node/raw/master/pictures/Wio%20App/sign%20in%2Blog%20in%2Bchoose%20server.png)

### **STEP 3**: Connect Wio Node WiFi AP
- Push and hold the CONFIG button until the blue LED turns into breathing mode (i.e blinking with fade in & fade out effect). It means that Wio node has turned to configuration mode successfully and can be detected by the Wio App.
![](https://github.com/SeeedDocument/Wio_Node/raw/master/pictures/Wio%20App/Confiture%20button.png)
- Push "Add your first Device".
- Choose Wio Node
- "Go to wifi list" will lead you to the wifi setting interface of yoour smartphone.

![](https://github.com/SeeedDocument/Wio_Node/raw/master/pictures/Wio%20App/Connect%20to%20Wio%20node%201.png)

- If you have successfully made the blue LED turn into breathing mode, you will find the wio node in the wifi list, connect to it!(Usually it is not called wio node in the wifi list, in the exsample, mine is Wio_091016, you may find one named wio_xxxxxx in your list.)
- Once connected, you will receive a notice, then you can go back to the app 
- Next step is connecting to the wifi of your home or company

![](https://github.com/SeeedDocument/Wio_Node/raw/master/pictures/Wio%20App/Connect%20to%20Wio%20node2.png)

- If there is password pf the wifi you want to connect,it may require you to enter the password
- Consider that you may need to connect more than 1 wio node in the future,a special name will make you distinguish them from each other easily.

![](https://github.com/SeeedDocument/Wio_Node/raw/master/pictures/Wio%20App/Connect%20to%20Wio%20node3.png)
### **STEP 4:** Virtually interconnect modules with Wio Node and update firmware
- Click the Wio Node and you will be in the main interface.
- There are 2 grove connectors, select the left one(D0).
- Because LED is output devices. choose output category
- Find the icon that looks like a bulb,choose it.
- Then you will find the bottom rectangle button becomes red and "View API" becomes "Update Firmware".Choose "Update Firmware"

![](https://github.com/SeeedDocument/Wio_Node/raw/master/pictures/Wio%20App/Connect%20modules%20with%20Wio%20node.png)

- Since you selected the D0 port to connect with LED in the APP, you need to connect the real Grove-LED to D0 port of Wio Node too.

![](https://github.com/SeeedDocument/Wio_Node/raw/master/pictures/Wio%20App/Wio_Node_Grove_LED.JPG)

### **STEP 5**: Test application using APIs
- Now that  you have successfully connect the LED to Wio Node,click "View API" to check the API of Wio Node
- Input "1" or "0" in the "Test Rquest" area,and click "Post" button and see what will happen.

## Get started with IFTTT & DoButton
----
Dont't know how to code? Don't worry,With the help of [IFTTT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IFTTT), even if you know nothing about coding, you are still able to build some simple projects.

If you don't have an IFTTT account,click [here](https://ifttt.com/join) to sign up.

If you already have an IFTTT account,click [here](https://ifttt.com/recipes/search?q=seeed) to connect with seeed, or search seeed at IFTTT website.There you will find 9 recipes by Seeed to teach you how to us e IFTTT.

What is DoButton? DoButtton is one of IFTTT's application that empowers you to create your own personalized button with just a tap,it is very suitable for building IoT projects and control it through your smartphone, here are two examples to show you how to use IFTTT&DoButton to make useful applications.
